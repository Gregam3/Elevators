# Strategies

Throughput is calculated as passengers offboarded/timesteps after 5000 timesteps

Simulation hyperparameter remained untouched throughout this process and elevator capacity did not exist in this phase.

### Deliver to closest floor
This strategy will always deliver the passenger closest to their floor,
regardless of when they entered the elevator

######Throughput = 0.33944413

### Deliver to furthest floor
This strategy will always deliver the passenger furthest to their floor,
regardless of when they entered the elevator. 

######Throughput = 0.1144

### Deliver to random floor
This strategy will always deliver the passenger furthest to their floor,
regardless of when they entered the elevator. 

######Throughput = 0.2694
